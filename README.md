# Hash Table and Tail Utility
    A pair of C utilities developed for the IJC course:
    Word Frequency Analyzer using a hash table for efficient word counting.
    Tail Utility to display the last n lines of a file (default: 10) via a circular buffer.
    This project showcases modular design, library creation (static and dynamic), and command-line tool development.
